##Background


We used glycogen as a model system to gain a better understanding of the parameters involved in carbohydrate branching and debranching. Due to the structural properties of starch and the complicated pathway to produce it in plants, it is a molecule difficult to model.  Glycogen is the starch analogue in bacteria. ADP-glucose is the glucosyl donor for the elgongation of the alpha-1,4-glucosidic chain in both bacteria and plants. Also, the main metabolic regulations occurs at the level of ADP-glucose synthesis in both organisms (1). Glycogen is characterized by a uniform and constant chemical structure and a well-described enzymatic pathway. Therefore, it is the perfect model molecule to test the effect of the  branching and debranching enzymes. 

The main aim of the project was to add acyl groups (as butyrate) to digestible starch. As a proof-of-concept, we expressed 5 putative acyltransferases into E. coli to see if we could get modified glycogen. However, the activity on these enzymes is still unknown. We don't know the position in the glucose molecule where the acyl group is putatively added. If the group is added to the free end available at a growing branch, it will disrupt the branch growth (2). 

We plan to have a final 5-10% of modified ends in a viable glycogen molecule (3). Therefore, the growth disruption caused by the addition of acyl groups needs to be minimum. 

Phosphorylation of starch has been previously characterized (2). According to Blennow A. et al, the phosphate groups bind at the free C-6 and C-3 hydroxyl groups of the glucose units. Both groups are located at the hydrophilic surface of the double helix, which might affect the stability of the helices or the side-by-side packing of the helices. 

We hypothesize that an excess of modification can disrupt the branching process and therefore the viability of the molecule, so we want to identify the modification limit to get stable glycogen molecules.
