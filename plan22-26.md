####Meetings 
Thursday 10-11 am

####Rooms available
Please use these times to meet and work on the wiki. You all should start doing some serious reading to write a background for the project. It is important to start collaborations with other teams!

- Monday 22 June 2-5 pm - Conf Centre Franklin (G37) Classroom
 - Thursday 25 June 2-5 pm - Chatt 220 Meeting Room

####Mathematical model

- The one you're already working on, based on length and branching of glycogen molecule. Write a document with the formulas (in latex maybe)  and the plots (similar to the ones they showed in the paper). Calculate number of free ends (A chains that are accesible for enzymatic attack)
- Try to write something similar to glycoplane. 2D representation of glycogen molecule. 
	
####Kinetic model
- Look for the glycogen biosynthesis pathway in E.coli in MetaCyc. Find out how all the reactions involved in the pathway are (reversible, irreversible, which are the substractes and products, reactions rates, kcat for the enzymes, etc). Write a table with all the showing all the reactions.
- To get a bit of background about enzyme kinetics, read [this](https://ww2.chemistry.gatech.edu/~lw26/bCourse_Information/3511/stud_comp/chap12_17.pdf) and [this](http://www.uscibooks.com/changten.pdf)
- Use COPASI to recreate the reactions one by one. [This iGEM team](http://2013.igem.org/Team:Uppsala/modeling-tutorial) has a great description of how to do this. You will need the concentrations of the species, some of them are [here](http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v5/n8/fig_tab/nchembio.186_T1.html) and the reactions constants (Km, Kcat...). If they're not in MetaCyc, look in Google or use a standard one. 
- Use the 'Time course' option in COPASI to plot how the reaction takes places as a function of time. 
- Generate differential equations with COPASI. Simiar to the ones they did in [Edinburgh 2008](http://2008.igem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Team:Edinburgh/Modelling/Kinetic#Ordinary_Differential_Equations)
