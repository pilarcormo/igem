Pilar is a biotechnologist with a recent interest in Bioinformatics. She first found out about iGEM when she was an undergrad student at the UPV in Valencia but she did not have an opportunity to be part of it until now. 
Pilar is currently a predoctoral student in Bioinformatics at [The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL)](http://www.tsl.ac.uk/staff/pilar-corredor-moreno/) and she is starting her PhD at The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) after the Jamboree. Her research interest focuses on plant-pathogen interactions and she wants to  apply transcriptomics and genomics to gain new insights about these interactions. As an advisor, Pilar has been mainly responsible for the computational aspect of the project. She has provided the biological background to the glycogen branching/debranching model and she has helped Josh to use his computer knowledge to address biological questions. She also facilitated the collaboration with the UPV Valencia iGEM team.
