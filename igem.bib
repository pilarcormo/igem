	Abstract = {Several aspects of glycogen optimization as an efficient fuel storage molecule have been studied in previous works: the chain length and the branching degree. These results demonstrated that the values of these variables in the cellular molecule are those that optimize the structure-function relationship. In the present work we show that structural homogeneity of the glycogen molecule is also an optimized variable that plays an important role in its metabolic function. This problem was studied by means of a two-dimensional approach, which allowed us to simplify the very complicated structure of glycogen. Our results demonstrate that there is a molecular size limit that guarantees the structural homogeneity, beyond which the structure of the molecule degenerates, as many chains do not grow. This strongly suggests that such a size limit is precisely what the molecule possesses in the cell.},

@article{Tagliabracci:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose that serves as an energy store. Phosphate, a trace constituent of glycogen, has profound effects on glycogen structure, and phosphate hyperaccumulation is linked to Lafora disease, a fatal progressive myoclonus epilepsy that can be caused by mutations of laforin, a glycogen phosphatase. However, little is known about the metabolism of glycogen phosphate. We demonstrate here that the biosynthetic enzyme glycogen synthase, which normally adds glucose residues to glycogen, is capable of incorporating the Î²-phosphate of its substrate UDP-glucose at a rate of one phosphate per approximately 10,000 glucoses, in what may be considered a catalytic error. We show that the phosphate in glycogen is present as C2 and C3 phosphomonoesters. Since hyperphosphorylation of glycogen causes Lafora disease, phosphate removal by laforin may thus be considered a repair or damage control mechanism.},

@article{Moreno-Bruna:2001aa,
	Abstract = {An adenosine diphosphate sugar pyrophosphatase (ASPPase, EC ) has been characterized by using Escherichia coli. This enzyme, whose activities in the cell are inversely correlated with the intracellular glycogen content and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, hydrolyzes ADP-glucose, the precursor molecule of glycogen biosynthesis. ASPPase was purified to apparent homogeneity (over 3,000-fold), and sequence analyses revealed that it is a member of the ubiquitously distributed group of nucleotide pyrophosphatases designated as "nudix" hydrolases. Insertional mutagenesis experiments leading to the inactivation of the ASPPase encoding gene, aspP, produced cells with marginally low enzymatic activities and higher glycogen content than wild-type bacteria. aspP was cloned into an expression vector and introduced into E. coli. Transformed cells were shown to contain a dramatically reduced amount of glycogen, as compared with the untransformed bacteria. No pleiotropic changes in the bacterial growth occurred in both the aspP-overexpressing and aspP-deficient strains. The overall results pinpoint the reaction catalyzed by ASPPase as a potential step of regulating glycogen biosynthesis in E. coli.},

RESULTS: Here, we present COPASI, a platform-independent and user-friendly biochemical simulator that offers several unique features. We discuss numerical issues with these features; in particular, the criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, hybrid deterministic-stochastic methods, and the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation.

@article{Ball:2003aa,
	Abstract = {Plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria synthesize storage polysaccharides by a similar ADPglucose-based pathway. Plant starch metabolism can be distinguished from that of bacterial glycogen by the presence of multiple forms of enzyme activities for each step of the pathway. This multiplicity does not coincide with any functional redundancy, as each form has seemingly acquired a distinctive and conserved role in starch metabolism. Comparisons of phenotypes generated by debranching enzyme-defective mutants in Escherichia coli and plants suggest that enzymes previously thought to be involved in polysaccharide degradation have been recruited during evolution to serve a particular purpose in starch biosynthesis. Speculations have been made that link this recruitment to the appearance of semicrystalline starch in photosynthetic eukaryotes. Besides the common core pathway, other enzymes of malto-oligosaccharide metabolism are required for normal starch metabolism. However, according to the genetic and physiological system under study, these enzymes may have acquired distinctive roles.},

	Abstract = {Optimization of molecular design in cellular metabolism is a necessary condition for guaranteeing a good structure-function relationship. We have studied this feature in the design of glycogen by means of the mathematical model previously presented that describes glycogen structure and its optimization function [Mel{\'e}ndez-Hevia et al. (1993), Biochem J 295: 477-483]. Our results demonstrate that the structure of cellular glycogen is in good agreement with these principles. Because the stored glucose in glycogen must be ready to be used at any phase of its synthesis or degradation, the full optimization of glycogen structure must also imply the optimization of every intermediate stage in its formation. This case can be viewed as a molecular instance of the eye problem, a classical paradigm of natural selection which states that every step in the evolutionary formation of a functional structure must be functional. The glycogen molecule has a highly optimized structure for its metabolic function, but the optimization of the full molecule has meaning and can be understood only by taking into account the optimization of each intermediate stage in its formation.},

	Abstract = {The animal glycogen molecule has to be designed in accordance with its metabolic function as a very effective fuel store allowing quick release of large amounts of glucose. In addition, the design should account for a high capacity of glucose storage in the least possible space. We have studied the optimization of these variables by means of a mathematical model of the glycogen molecule. Our results demonstrate that the structure is optimized to maximize (a) the total glucose stored in the smallest possible volume, (b) the proportion of it that can be directly released by phosphorylase before any debranching occurs, and (c) the number of non-reducing ends (points of attack for phosphorylase), which maximizes the speed of fuel release. The optimization of these four variables is achieved with appropriate values for two key parameters in glycogen design: the degree of branching and the length of the chains. The optimal values of these two parameters are precisely those found in cellular glycogen.},

@article{Fox:1976aa,
	Abstract = {The Escherichia coli B glycogen synthase has been purified to apparent homogeneity with the use of a 4-aminobutyl-Sepharose column. Two fractions of the enzyme were obtained: glycogen synthase I with a specific activity of 380 mumol mg-1 and devoid of branching enzyme activity and glycogen synthase II having a specific activity of 505 mumol mg-1 and containing branching enzyme activity which was 0.1% of the activity observed for the glycogen synthase. Only one protein band was found in disc gel electrophoresis for each glycogen synthase fraction and they were coincident with glycogen synthase activity. One major protein band and one very faint protein band which hardly moved into the gel were observed in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the glycogen synthase fractions. The subunit molecular weight of the major protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of both glycogen synthase fractions was determined to be 49 000 +/- 2 000. The molecular weights of the native enzymes were determined by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation. Glycogen synthase I had a molecular weight of 93 000 while glycogen synthase II had a molecular weight of 200 000. On standing at 4 degrees C or at -85 degrees C both enzymes transform into species having molecular weights of 98 000, 135 000, and 185 000. Thus active forms of the E. coli B glycogen synthase can exist as dimers, trimers, and tetramers of the subunit. The enzyme was shown to catalyze transfer of glucose from ADPglucose to maltose and to higher oligosaccharides of the maltodextrin series but not to glucose. 1,5-Gluconolactone was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the glycogen synthase reaction. The glycogen synthase reaction was shown to be reversible. Formation of labeled ADPglucose occurred from either [14C]ADP or [14C]glycogen. The ratio of ADP to ADPglucose at equilibrium at 37 degrees C was determined and was found to vary threefold in the pH range of 5.27-6.82. From these data the ratio of ADP2- to ADPglucose at equilibrium was determined to be 45.8 +/- 4.5. Assuming that deltaF degrees of the hydrolysis of the alpha-1,4-glucosidic linkage is -4.0 kcal the deltaF degrees of hydrolysis of the glucosidic linkage in ADPglucose is -6.3 kcal.},

	Abstract = {Branching enzyme belongs to the alpha-amylase family, which includes enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis or transglycosylation at alpha-(1,4)- or alpha-(1,6)-glucosidic linkages. In the alpha-amylase family, four highly conserved regions are proposed to make up the active site. From amino acid sequence analysis a tyrosine residue is completely conserved in the alpha-amylase family. In Escherichia coli branching enzyme, this residue (Y300) is located prior to the conserved region 1. Site-directed mutagenesis of the Y300 residue in E. coli branching enzyme was used in order to study its possible function in branching enzymes. Replacement of Y300 with Ala, Asp, Leu, Ser, and Trp resulted in mutant enzymes with less than 1% of wild-type activity. A Y300F substitution retained 25% of wild-type activity. Kinetic analysis of Y300F showed no effect on the Km value. The heat stability of Y300F was analyzed, and this was lowered significantly compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. Y300F also showed lower relative activity at elevated temperatures compared to wild-type. Thus, these results show that Tyr residue 300 in E. coli branching enzyme is important for activity and thermostability of the enzyme.},

@article{Figueroa:2011aa,
	Abstract = {ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is the enzyme responsible for the regulation of glycogen synthesis in bacteria. The enzyme N-terminal domain has a Rossmann-like fold with three neighbor loops facing the substrate ATP. In the Escherichia coli enzyme, one of those loops also faces the regulatory site containing Lys(39), a residue involved in binding of the allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and its analog pyridoxal-phosphate. The other two loops contain Trp(113) and Gln(74), respectively, which are highly conserved among all the ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases. Molecular modeling of the E. coli enzyme showed that binding of ATP correlates with conformational changes of the latter two loops, going from an open to a closed (substrate-bound) form. Alanine mutants of Trp(113) or Gln(74) did not change apparent affinities for the substrates, but they became insensitive to activation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. By capillary electrophoresis we found that the mutant enzymes still bind fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, with similar affinity as the wild type enzyme. Since the mutations did not alter binding of the activator, they must have disrupted the communication between the regulatory and the substrate sites. This agrees with a regulatory mechanism where the interaction with the allosteric activator triggers conformational changes at the level of loops containing residues Trp(113) and Gln(74).},

	Abstract = {Based on primary amino acid sequence comparisons with other phosphoglucomutases, 12 conserved residues in the Acetobacter xylinum phosphoglucomutase (CelB) were substituted by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in mutant enzymes with Kcat values [glucose-1-phosphate (G-1-P) to glucose-6-phosphate] ranging from 0 to 46% relative to that of the wild-type enzyme. In combination with a versatile set of plasmid expression vectors these proteins were used in a metabolic engineering study on sugar catabolism in Escherichia coli. Mutants of E. coli deficient in phosphoglucomutase synthesize intracellular amylose when grown on galactose, due to accumulation of G-1-P. Wild-type celB can complement this lesion, and we show here that the ability of the mutant enzymes to complement is sensitive to variations in their respective in vitro determined Kcat and Km G-1-P values. Reduced catalytic efficiencies could be compensated by increasing the CelB expression level, and in this way a mutant protein (substitution of Thr-45 to Ala) displaying a 7600-fold reduced catalytic efficiency could be used to eliminate the amylose accumulation. Complementation experiments with the homologous phosphoglucomutase indicated that a Km G-1-P value significantly below that of CelB is not critical for the in vivo conversion of the substrate.},

Butyrate is important in the regulation of the colonocyte cell cycle and gut motility and may also reduce the risk of large bowel cancer. We have shown that dietary butyrylated starch can deliver butyrate to the large bowel in a sustained manner. We hypothesized that ingestion of butyrylated starch increases large bowel butyrate levels and decreases colonic contractility. Groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8) were fed AIN-93G-based diet containing a highly digestible low-amylose maize starch (LAMS) control or 5% or 10% butyrylated LAMS (LAMSB) for 10 days. We found that cecal but not colonic tissue weight as well as cecal and distal colonic digesta weights and fecal output were higher in LAMSB fed rats. Butyrylated LAMS lowered digesta pH throughout the large bowel. Cecal, proximal, and distal colonic butyrate pools and portal venous butyrate concentrations were higher in rats fed LAMSB. Electrically stimulated and receptor-dependent carbachol and prostaglandin E(2)-induced isotonic contractions were lower in isolated intact sections of proximal colon (P < .05) but not the terminal ileum after 10% LAMSB ingestion. These results demonstrated that elevation of butyrate levels in the large bowel of the rat correlated with reduction of contractile activity of the colonic musculature, which may assist in the reabsorption of water and minerals.},

	Abstract = {Microorganisms have the capacity to utilize a variety of nutrients and adapt to continuously changing environmental conditions. Many microorganisms, including yeast and bacteria, accumulate carbon and energy reserves to cope with the starvation conditions temporarily present in the environment. Glycogen biosynthesis is a main strategy for such metabolic storage, and a variety of sensing and signaling mechanisms have evolved in evolutionarily distant species to ensure the production of this homopolysaccharide. At the most fundamental level, the processes of glycogen synthesis and degradation in yeast and bacteria share certain broad similarities. However, the regulation of these processes is sometimes quite distinct, indicating that they have evolved separately to respond optimally to the habitat conditions of each species. This review aims to highlight the mechanisms, both at the transcriptional and at the post-transcriptional level, that regulate glycogen metabolism in yeast and bacteria, focusing on selected areas where the greatest increase in knowledge has occurred during the last few years. In the yeast system, we focus particularly on the various signaling pathways that control the activity of the enzymes of glycogen storage. We also discuss our recent understanding of the important role played by the vacuole in glycogen metabolism. In the case of bacterial glycogen, special emphasis is placed on aspects related to the genetic regulation of glycogen metabolism and its connection with other biological processes.},
