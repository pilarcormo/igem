2008 - Edinburgh. They made glycogen (starches are mixed - branched and not branched, so they unbranch the glycogen selectively). If we make it from scratch -> amylose only. Amylose is insoluble. amount of debranching enzymes controlled in vitro. branching enzymes that have a external control so we can switch it on and off. glyC glyB background. measure amount of acetylation. E.coli.

inducible branching enzyme (biobrick) 

Idin assay -> different intensity of color (reduction of color if high branching). or debranch what you've made and measure the number of branches (more quantitative). DNase assay...

- branching enzyme, debranching enzyme (biobricks) Biobrick backbone with RBS/Plac
- Glycogen-like molecule. 
- Plac debranching. 
- Acetylation/Buryratilation enzyme  - modification enzymes (biobricks or golden gate). 
- Also a represor switch 
- Parts we should be clonning 

Resistant starch

plants - golden gate clonning. 

Buryrated starch? No enzyme. We may add it (butyrate) in the media. The production of butyric acid from butyryl-CoA during acidogenic phase happens through a reversible pathway consisting of two enzymes, i.e., butyrate kinase (Buk) and phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb) [http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/6/1/128](http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/6/1/128). Feeding acetate -> Butyryl-CoA to butyrate by using acetate as an aceptor. Or feeding butyrate to produce butyrated starch. 

###Model
Induction and debranching. Number of free ends. 
matematical model for branching. figure out the pathway for butyrate addition.

### 8 enzymes
Synthesize the enzymes. 
As biobricks parts. 
Switch we might use. what is comming in the kit. 
Biobrick assembly and golden gate assembly. 

### Communication, activities. Outreach
